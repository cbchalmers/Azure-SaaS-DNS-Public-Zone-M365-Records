 * # Project Details
 *
 * ## Title
 * 
 * Host your public DNS records on an Azure DNS Zone
 *
 * ## Description
 *
 * Provision an Azure DNS Zone to host your public DNS records which are required for Microsoft 365; covering Exchange Online, Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business, and Mobile Device Management for Office 365. Intention of this project is to have the DNS records configuration managed. 
 *
 * #### Resources Provisioned
 * 
 * * Public DNS Zone
 * * CNAME, MX, SRV and TXT Records Required for Microsoft 365
 *
 * ### Prerequisites
 * 
 * * [Download and Install Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
 * * [Create a Service Principal for Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/guides/service_principal_client_secret.html#creating-a-service-principal)
 *
 * ### Installing
 * 
 * * Populate client_id and client_secret inside global_main.tf from the Service Principal you created in the prerequisites
 * * Populate subscription_id and tenant_id inside global_main.tf from your Azure tenant information
 *
 * The [terraform init](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html) command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. This is the first command that should be run after writing a new Terraform configuration or cloning an existing one from version control. It is safe to run this command multiple times
 *
 * ```
 * terraform init
 * ```
 * 
 * The [terraform plan](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html) command is used to create an execution plan. Terraform performs a refresh, unless explicitly disabled, and then determines what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state specified in the configuration files. This command is a convenient way to check whether the execution plan for a set of changes matches your expectations without making any changes to real resources or to the state. For example, terraform plan might be run before committing a change to version control, to create confidence that it will behave as expected.
 * 
 * ```
 * terraform plan
 * ```
 * 
 * The [terraform apply](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html) command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a terraform plan execution plan.
 * 
 * ```
 * terraform apply
 * ```
 * 
 * Update your Domain Registrar to use the Azure Name Servers that are provided to you within thee DNS Zone. eg ns1-08.azure-dns.com, ns2-08.azure-dns.net, ns3-08.azure-dns.org and ns4-08.azure-dns.info. They are randomly assigned as you provision the zone. 
 * 
 * ### Removing
 * 
 * The [terraform destroy](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/destroy.html) command is used to destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure.
 * 
 * ```
 * terraform destroy
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Built With
